# Interactive documentation

This is our take on creating a documentation for our grid that is supposed to be simple, explorative and fun to use.

## Developing

1. Run `npm i`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:4000

⚠️ Notice: By default Vue prohibits binding data to <style> tags. We’re using a little hack to work around this issue. Because of that hot reloading will add the styles each time it hot reloads. This MAY result in memory/performance issues while developing. Just hard-reload the page to circumvent this problem.
